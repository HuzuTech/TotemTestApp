#Totem Test App

This is an ongoing demonstration of how to use the
[Totem](https://github.com/HuzuTech/HAPI.App.Avatars) library in the
context of a [HAPI.App](https://github.com/HuzuTech/HAPI.App).

##Installation

You must have [HAPI.App](https://github.com/HuzuTech/HAPI.App)
installed as a global node module:

```npm install -g hapi.app```

Change into the app's root directory and install dependencies:

```npm install```

Set up the app as a valid HAPI client:

```hapi setup```

Run the server:

```hapi start```

Now navigate to `http://localhost:[port]`.
